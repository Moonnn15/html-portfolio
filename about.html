<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Monalisa Bhattacharjee, a passionate Computer Science student with a curiosity for technology and creativity. I enjoy exploring the world of coding, solving problems, and learning new tools that help bring ideas to life. Whether it’s designing a website, developing a small app, or understanding the logic behind algorithms, I love the process of creating something meaningful.</p>

<p>I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (Core) and actively building my skills in programming, web development, and teamwork. I’ve been part of student tech groups and collaborative projects where I contributed ideas, helped organize events, and worked on hands-on tasks. Along the way, I’ve also grown my interest in fields like UI/UX design and project management.</p>

<p>Beyond tech, I enjoy creative activities and constantly look for ways to improve myself. I believe in learning by doing, staying adaptable, and helping teams work smoothly together. Through this portfolio, I hope to share my work, growth, and passion with others.</p>
